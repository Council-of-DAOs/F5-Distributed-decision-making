 # F5: Distributed decision making

# A Council of Catalyst DAOs

Several Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have already emerged in the orbit of the Catalyst community.

A greater synergy is needed between them and Project Catalyst by providing an opportunity for research and a way to better integrate each of their experiences with the larger community.

Therefore, we propose the creation of an Open-Source platform where representatives from each DAO and Project Catalyst can research, communicate and document Distributed Autonomous Organisations.
